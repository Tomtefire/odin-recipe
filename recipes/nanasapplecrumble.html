        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A family favorite, this apple crumble was originally my grandmother Hazel's recipe which my mom made on a regular basis. She would make two at a time to take to sick or shut-in friends, or to potlucks. There is never any left. Serve warm with French vanilla yogurt.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon, or more to taste </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
