Introduction:
This is the first assignment in the Odin Project where i will be implementing the basics that i have learned so far. I will be creating a recipe site with a couple of different recipes.

Reflection afterwards:
The recipe page ended up looking decent for not having css added. Overall i would say that i am quite proud with some improvments available
